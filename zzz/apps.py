"""
Django AppConfig for the 'zzz' application.

This module initializes the APScheduler background task scheduler when Django starts.
The scheduler replaces traditional cron jobs with in-process scheduled tasks that run
management commands at specific intervals.

Scheduled Tasks:
    - chat_messages: Runs at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 (sends chat notification emails)
    - vote: Runs daily at 08:05 (processes voting, creates 1-to-1 chat rooms)
    - count_citizens: Runs every minute (manages user reputation and activation)
    - update_site: Runs every hour (syncs Site model with environment variables)

The scheduler only starts when SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true is set in the environment
or when RUN_MAIN=true (Django development server reload detection).
